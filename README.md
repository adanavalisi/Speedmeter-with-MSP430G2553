# Speedmeter-with-MSP430G2553

This project shows how to make a speed measurement circuit with msp430 development card. 

How it works:

You have two object sensors on the circuit. If the first sensor detects any object counter(clock) starts to count. After the second sensor detects the object it stops to count and calculate the speed. Distance between sensors is up  to you, you can freely change it in the project. After calculation, it displays the speed of the object on the displayer. If speed is more than the threshold value an overspeed warning shows up on the screen.
